//Cycle Detection.
//We can detect cycles in directed as well as undirected graphs.
//Three are 3 ways to detect cycles in undirected graph: dfs, bfs, Disjoint set union.
//Three are 3 ways to detect cycles in directed graph: dfs, bfs, Kahns Algorithm(Topological Sort).
//Cycle Detection in Undirected Graph. We will return true if cycle exists and will return false if cycle doesn't exist.
